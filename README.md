# React + Vite

I am very happy to get this job and finish the project perfectly.The interesting thing is that this project is done without a backend  and uses local stores and React's code functionality. If I had used a server I could have added more functionality to make this project more interesting. I hope you will kindly forgive my mistakes. Some of the functionality is mentioned below.
