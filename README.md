# React + Vite

I am very happy to get this task and finish the project perfectly.The interesting thing is that this project is done without a backend server and uses local storage and React's code functionality. If I had used a server I could have added more functionality to make this project more interesting. I hope you will kindly forgive my mistakes. Some of the functionality is mentioned below. 

- Login &Register / Home/Landing View 
- Product List View / image click show Product Detail View 
- Delete Product from Cart
- Admin Dashboard / Overview / Summary 
- Admin Order List / Admin Order Detail View 
- Admin Product List / Product Detail View 
- Add new Product in admin dashbord
